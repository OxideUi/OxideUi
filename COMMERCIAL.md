 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The StratoSDK Commercial License is a proprietary license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to enable
commercial use of the StratoSDK framework without the copyleft
restrictions of the GNU Affero General Public License.

  This license allows you to use, modify, and distribute StratoSDK
in commercial applications without the requirement to release your
application's source code under the AGPL. This dual-licensing
approach ensures that StratoSDK remains free and open source for
the community while providing commercial flexibility for businesses.

  The StratoSDK framework consists of multiple components including
the core framework (strato-core), rendering engine (strato-renderer),
widget library (strato-widgets), platform abstraction layer
(strato-platform), macro system (strato-macros), CLI tools, and
development kit with comprehensive documentation and examples.

  The precise terms and conditions for using, copying, distribution
and modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 1.0 of the StratoSDK Commercial License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to the StratoSDK framework and any copyrightable work
licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you".
"Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  "Commercial Use" means any use of the Program that is primarily intended
for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  1. Grant of License.

  Subject to the terms and conditions of this License and payment of the
applicable license fee as specified in a separate License Agreement, the
Licensor hereby grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
irrevocable license to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, and
distribute the Program and derivative works thereof in source code or object
code form for Commercial Use within your organization and products, provided

    proprietary notices contained in the Program;
    
    c) Use the names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the
    Licensor to endorse or promote products derived from this Program
    without specific prior written permission;
    
    d) Sublicense the Program to third parties without explicit written
    consent from the Licensor. This license is granted for internal use

  5. Warranty Disclaimer.

  THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  6. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA
OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  The total liability of the Licensor under this License shall not exceed
the amount paid by you for the License.

  7. Termination.

  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
if you fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within
30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Upon termination, you shall
discontinue all use of the Program and destroy all copies, full or partial,
of the Program.

  8. Governing Law.

  This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of Italy, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Any
legal action or proceeding arising under this License will be brought
exclusively in the courts of Milan, Italy.

  9. Entire Agreement.

  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the use of the Program licensed hereunder and supersedes all
prior or contemporaneous understandings regarding such subject matter.

  10. License Purchase and Validity.

  The purchase of this commercial license is governed by a separate License
Agreement between the Licensee and the Licensor. Payment of the applicable
license fee as specified in the License Agreement is a condition precedent
to the validity and effectiveness of this License.
